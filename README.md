# CSS Week

## Monday

- Layout

    Using layout.html and layout.js, we designed a page that has a spatially designed layout. Each element, instead of being based on content and floating left/right, is given a percentage of the page to occupy.

    Layout.js is only used to color the divs on the layout.html page. Do not edit/worry too much about the javascript.

- Animations Intro

    keyframes

        from & to - useful for 2 state animation, a start and finish
            from sets the beginning
            to sets the end
        percentages - thinking of your animation more as a video that you're editing, you can add styles that control what the target should be doing at certain parts of the animation. In the example, the emoji starts at 0, halfway through its animation it is across the page. 100% aka at the end of the animation, it should be back where it started at 0
